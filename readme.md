Describe your application here and what it does

Using a fresh clone of the webpack-starter
Remember to refer to our notes and the redux chat app for getting the store and reducer setup.
Create a web app that requires a user to login in order to use it.

Once logged in, a user should be able to create a new task with a form. A task should have a name, description, state, important, and due date fields.

Make sure you create this table on backendless with all the appropriate constraints and types.
A user should also be able to see a list of all their tasks in tabular format. A user should NOT be able to see any tasks created by another user.

To login as a user, refer to the backendless rest api docs

For your example accounts use an email you own or the @example.com domain.

Do not make up email addresses for testing

Use the same easy to remember password for all your user accounts, I strongly recommend going with just password as its easy to remember and should never be used as a real password.

To request data from the server, refer to the backendless rest api docs ;

To save a record to the database, refer to the backendless API documentation

To make any requests to backendless you will need the 3 things listed below. Make sure you store those in your app somewhere when getting started;

The backendless endpoint URL
Your application ID
Your REST secret key
